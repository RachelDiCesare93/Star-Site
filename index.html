        <h2> All about Angelica!</h2>
        <div class="half-width">
          <p>Ladies and Gentleman,Boys and Girls! My name is Angelica Pickles. I
          like to pick on the dumb babies,play with my favorite doll Cynthia!
            (Oh, and sometimes Susie Charmichael),eat lots of cookies,pet my
            cat Fluffy,and  practice being  SHINING STAR! Of course my daddy
            says that I have to share the spotlight with everybody else, but I am
            tired of practicing with the dumb babies,so I thought I will start my
            own SHOWBIZNESS! There are many things you can do to be a Shining Star,
            but my favorites are singing,dancing and acting! Even though I am
            the best, I will give lessons on how to do those 3 things!</p>
          </div>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I can hold lessons at the playground,friday,saturday and sunday.
              Make sure you tell your mommy and daddy to give you a microphone,
              dance shoes (ballet,tap and jazz) and a beret.I will provide
              dressup clothes,music,milk and cookies.You should bring some snacks
              too.We will do lessons for 3 hours, as I like to spend time playing
              with Cynthia.Before you enter my area you must pay a price of $5.
              We will have so much fun with my lessons because like I said,
              I'm the bestest in the whole wide world.</p>
